# transit-swift

Transit is a data format and a set of libraries for conveying values between applications written in different languages. This library provides support for marshalling Transit data to/from Cocoa and Cocoa Touch data types.

* [Rationale](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit)
* [Specification](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)

This implementation's major.minor version number corresponds to the
version of the Transit specification it supports.

_NOTE: Transit is a work in progress and may evolve based on feedback. As a result, while Transit is a great option for transferring data between applications, it should not yet be used for storing data durably over time. This recommendation will change when the specification is complete._

## Releases and Dependency Information

* Latest release: 0.8.259

## Usage

```Swift
(require '[cognitect.transit :as transit])
(import [java.io ByteArrayInputStream ByteArrayOutputStream])

;; Write data to a stream
(def out (ByteArrayOutputStream. 4096))
(def writer (transit/writer out :json))
(transit/write writer "foo")
(transit/write writer {:a [1 2]})

;; Take a peek at the JSON
(.toString out)
;; => "{\"~#'\":\"foo\"} [\"^ \",\"~:a\",[1,2]]"

;; Read data from a stream
(def in (ByteArrayInputStream. (.toByteArray out)))
(def reader (transit/reader in :json))
(prn (transit/read reader))  ;; => "foo"
(prn (transit/read reader))  ;; => {:a [1 2]}
```

```Objective-C
(require '[cognitect.transit :as transit])
(import [java.io ByteArrayInputStream ByteArrayOutputStream])

;; Write data to a stream
(def out (ByteArrayOutputStream. 4096))
(def writer (transit/writer out :json))
(transit/write writer "foo")
(transit/write writer {:a [1 2]})

;; Take a peek at the JSON
(.toString out)
;; => "{\"~#'\":\"foo\"} [\"^ \",\"~:a\",[1,2]]"

;; Read data from a stream
(def in (ByteArrayInputStream. (.toByteArray out)))
(def reader (transit/reader in :json))
(prn (transit/read reader))  ;; => "foo"
(prn (transit/read reader))  ;; => {:a [1 2]}
```
